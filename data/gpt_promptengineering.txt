Please give me prompts that will be used for image generation using the diffuion model.
The prompt should be related to "Ocean". It will generate dynamic videos using it.
Thus, give me prompts that dynamically illustrates the movements, motions or animations of the object.
Make the motions as dynamic as possible. Fast moving scenes are required.
Also, the prompts should be related to futuristic ocean scenes.

For example,
"The camera slowly moves forward toward seashells and conch shells on the sandy beach in a low-angle view. The camera's focus is fixed on seashells and conch shells. The sky is very clear and full of puffy clouds. The sun shines peacefully on the sandy beach. On the beautiful snady beach, seashells and conch shells are half buried in the sand. The waves gently hit the sandly beach, hit the clams and conch shells, and the clams and conch shells disappear into the sand. Peaceful and calm atmosphere, National Geographic documentary style video, dynamic motion, high quality, best quality, high detailed, 16k"
""A swarm of cybernetic jellyfish pulses through the open ocean, their tentacles trailing bioluminescent tendrils that cast a vibrant tapestry of light across the dark waters. The camera smoothly tracks alongside them, shifting between underwater and surface perspectives. In the distance, a colossal floating platform hums with activity as its silhouette is outlined against a sky illuminated by twin moons. Advanced drones zip above and below the waves, scanning and analyzing the mysterious glow emanating from the techno-organic creatures. Sci-fi immersion, luminescent beauty, high-octane pursuit, 16k precision."
"The camera swoops down from the shimmering rainbow skies, diving through layers of mist and bursting through towering crystalline waves that crest and crash with a gleaming transparency. The view glides over a mega-yacht composed entirely of sleek, transparent materials seamlessly interacting with the ocean's surface. Onboard, people and androids engage in synchronized water sports, riding waves on anti-gravity surfboards. Holographic displays project animations directly onto the water, crafting detailed worlds and stories for riders to explore. Dynamic water animation, futuristic elegance, hyper-realistic detail, immersive recreation playgrounds."
"A swirling maelstrom opens in the vast, midnight-blue expanse of the ocean, ringed by an array of gargantuan energy siphons, drinking in and stabilizing the massive force of nature. The camera spirals rapidly around the vortex, capturing the whirlpool's chaotic dance while seamlessly transitioning into the eye of the storm, where an enigmatic structure harnesses its power. Pilotless hydro-skimmers race around the edge, their trails illuminating the surface with glowing geometric patterns. Sci-fi marvel, powerful forces of nature, 16k hyper-detail, kinetic beauty in engineering."
